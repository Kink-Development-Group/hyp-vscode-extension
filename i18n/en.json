  "freeze": "**freeze** - Declares an immutable binding.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\nfreeze PI: number = 3.14159;\n```\n\n**Description:** Protects the assigned value from further mutation, ideal for constants and feature flags.",
  "whisper": "**whisper** - Prints text without adding a newline.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\nwhisper \"processing \";\nwhisper \"...\";\n```\n\n**Description:** Streams partial output so you can assemble sentences or progress indicators manually.",
  "oscillate": "**oscillate** - Toggles a boolean variable.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\noscillate isActive;\n```\n\n**Description:** Flips the truth value of the provided identifier, useful for blinking UI or feature switches.",
  "anchor": "**anchor** - Captures the current state for later restoration.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\nanchor savedCounter = counter;\n```\n\n**Description:** Stores the present value under a named anchor so you can revert temporary changes without manual bookkeeping.",
  "implant": "**implant** - Declares a variable with intentional semantics.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\nimplant secretValue: number = 999;\n```\n\n**Description:** Signals that a value was imprinted deliberately, often used for secrets or ritual constants.",
  "trigger": "**trigger** - Declares a reusable callback that can be fired later on.",
  "finale": "**finale** - Closing block that executes before `Relax` to perform clean-up tasks.",
  "command": "**command** - Emits highlighted, imperative output for dramatic effect.",
  "entrance": "**entrance** - Defines the initial execution block.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\nFocus {\n    entrance {\n        observe \"Initialization...\";\n    }\n    // other code\n} Relax\n```\n\n**Description:** When present, the code in an `entrance` block is executed first. Use it to set up your environment or initialize resources.",
  "deepFocus": "**deepFocus** - Alternative block syntax for code grouping.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\nif (counter > 5) deepFocus {\n    observe \"Counter is greater than 5\";\n}\n```\n\n**Description:** Offers an alternative to standard curly braces, enhancing readability for complex nested structures.",
  "call": "**call** - Invokes a function.\n\n**Usage Example:**\n```hyp\ncall add(5, 10);\n```\n\n**Description:** Explicitly calls a previously defined function. Beneficial in contexts where function binding might be ambiguous.",
